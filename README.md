# Clean Code Workshop - SmellyShapes (Java)
This is the Java version of Smelly Shapes that belong to the [Clean Code Course](https://www.zuehlke.com/ch/en/about-us/academy/training/details/clean-code-workshop-java/) by ZÃ¼hlke

## About the Course
Clean code allows software to be continually adapted to new requirements. Although most developers know what clean code should look like, how to specifically recognise bad code and, step-by-step, convert it into good code is often less clear.

The course takes the form of a workshop with numerous practical exercises and involves working together in two-man teams. To facilitate transferral of what they have learnt to their everyday work, participants work through tasks in their own IDEs.

The focus is less about conveying knowledge and more about working through the topic together in order to create a culture in which code quality and collective code improvement are natural, everyday issues.

## Goals
Participants will develop a shared understanding of how to recognise bad code and how it can be restructured into better code. They will learn to see their own code through the eyes of another developer and thus how to make it more readable and comprehensible.
